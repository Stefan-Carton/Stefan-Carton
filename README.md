Hi, I’m @Stefan-Carton also known as Stefan Carton.

I’m a Senior Business Analyst, who knows juuuust enough code to solve the occasional problem and tends to write 300 lines of comments for 15 lines of actually executiable code. 
I'll probably use this if I have something professional to show off, but at the moment, not so much.


Things I know well:
- SQL
- Power BI DAX
- Excel (if it counts?)

Things I can vaguely assemble given enough time:
- PowerShell
- VBA
- Power BI M Query 
- Some really janky Oracle Cloud Jobs Scripts for deploying Wordpress via their free ARM setup, details here if the domain has been maintained: https://businessanalysis.space/our-hosting/

Interested in picking up one day:
- Android ROM development, along the lines of Cyanogenmod and LineageOS. Used that system for a long time, big fan.
